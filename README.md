I'm providing a list of headers that the README MUST have below. You're free to add more content if you wish:

1. A brief abstract of your project including the problem statement and solution approach. If the project has cool visual results, you may provide one image or GIF of the results. See this for reference.

2. A list of code dependencies.

3. Detailed instructions for running the code, preferably, command instructions that may reproduce the declared results. If your code requires a model that can't be provided on GitHub, store it somewhere else and provide a download link.

4. Results: If numerical, mention them in tabular format. If visual, display. If you've done a great project, this is the area to show it!

5. Additional details, discussions, etc.

6. References.
